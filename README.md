# EnsembleLearning Final Project

## Challenge Overview
The goal of the challenge is to explain electricity prices from weather, energy and commercial data from France and Germany, to estimate the daily price variation of electricity (futures) contracts, in both countries.

From this goal we identified two main objectives:
- How to predict the variation of electricity price?
- Which features predict the best the price of electricity?

To answer to these objectives, you will find 3 notebooks with our work: the data exploration, the data preprocessing and our models.
